Power BI Dashboard
Power Bi Dashboard 📊 Project Overview: An interactive Power BI dashboard providing comprehensive analysis of credit card transactions and customer behavior patterns. This project delivers actionable insights into revenue streams, customer demographics, and transaction trends to drive data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Project Objectives: Analyze Revenue Performance: Track quarterly revenue trends and identify key revenue drivers across different customer segments, Customer Segmentation: Understand customer demographics and their contribution to overall revenue, Transaction Pattern Analysis: Examine transaction volumes, payment methods, and spending categories and Strategic Insights: Provide actionable recommendations to optimize credit card portfolio performance

📁 Dataset Information: The analysis is based on two primary datasets: Transaction Data: Credit card transaction details including revenue, transaction amounts, card categories, and payment methods, Customer Data: Demographic information including age, education, occupation, income groups, and geographic distribution

Key Metrics Analyzed:
Total Revenue: ₹55.3M, Total Transaction Amount: ₹445M, Total Interest Earned: ₹7.8M, Transaction Count: 656K and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS): 3.19

🛠️ Steps Followed:

Data Collection & Preparation: Imported transaction and customer datasets into Power BI. Performed data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy. Created relationships between transaction and customer tables.

Data Modeling: Established primary and foreign key relationships. Created calculated columns for derived metrics (Revenue, Interest Earned). Built DAX measures for dynamic calculations (QTR comparisons, YoY growth).

Dashboard Design: Designed two interactive dashboards: Transaction Report: Focus on revenue streams and transaction patterns. Customer Report: Focus on demographic analysis and customer behavior. Implemented dynamic filters (Week, Quarter, Card Category, Gender). Applied consistent color schemes and visual hierarchy.

Visualization Development: Bar charts for categorical comparisons (Education, Job Type, Expense Categories). Line charts for temporal trends (Weekly revenue patterns). KPI cards for key metrics. Tables for detailed breakdowns by card category and customer job.

Insights Generation: Analyzed patterns across multiple dimensions, Identified top-performing segments and underperforming areas, Generated actionable recommendations.

🔍 Key Insights:

Revenue Performance: Q3 leads revenue with ₹14.2M, showing 6.8% growth over Q4 (₹13.3M), Blue card category dominates with 83% of total revenue (₹46M), indicating strong mass-market appeal, Swipe transactions generate highest revenue (₹35M or 63%), followed by Chip (₹17M) and Online (₹3M).

Customer Demographics: Businessmen are top revenue generators (₹17M), followed by White-collar professionals (₹10M), Graduate customers contribute most (₹22M or 40% of revenue), highlighting educated customer base, 40-50 age group leads spending (₹14M), representing peak earning years, High-income group generates 40% revenue despite being a smaller segment.

Geographic & Behavioral Patterns: Top 5 states (TX, NY, CA, FL, NJ) contribute significantly to revenue, Married customers show higher engagement with consistent spending patterns, Bills and Entertainment are primary expense categories (₹14M each), Customers with 2-3 dependents show higher transaction values.

Areas of Concern: Low online transaction adoption (only 5% of revenue) indicates digital payment gap. Platinum card underperformance (₹1M revenue) suggests need for premium segment strategy. Customer Satisfaction Score of 3.19 has room for improvement. Post-Graduate and Doctorate holders contribute only ₹3M+₹2M, indicating untapped potential.

📈 Business Impact: Implementing these recommendations can potentially: Increase online transaction revenue by 150% through digital adoption, Boost premium segment by 200% with improved Platinum offerings, Improve CSS to 4.0+ through enhanced customer experience, Reduce quarterly volatility with targeted Q4 campaigns, Acquire 15-20% more high-value customers through educated segment focus.
